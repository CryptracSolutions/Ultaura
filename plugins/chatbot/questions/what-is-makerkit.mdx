question: "What is Makerkit?"
---

MakerKit is the Next.js boilerplate project for SaaS built to get you started on the right foot.

The MakerKit kit is a fully-featured Next.js application that uses Supabase for authentication, database, and storage.

This version of the kit uses the new App Router introduced with Next.js 13, which is built on top of the new React Server Components.

## Features

### Tech Stack
We built MakerKit with some of the best technologies available today, such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase:

1. Scalable Next.js RSC (app directory) structure template, perfect for the
most ambitious projects
2. Beautiful Tailwind 3 CSS theme - with dark mode!
3. Full Supabase setup, including Authentication, Database and Storage
4. Reusable UI components as building blocks (which you can easily swap with
your own or your favorite library) based on Radix UI
5. SSR-compatible Authentication flow, including 3rd-party providers (Google,
Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc.)

### Template Features
MakerKit is fully functioning from the beginning and comes with the following features:

1. Payments with Stripe, and support for subscriptions (or, alternatively,
using Lemon Squeezy)
2. Onboarding flow, which allows your users to set up their accounts and
create their organization
3. Organizations: users can create and edit organizations. An organization is
a group of users. You can rename the Organization entity according to your domain (for example, teams, projects, etc.)
4. Team Members: users can invite other users to join their organization and
assign them a role
5. MDX-powered Blog and Documentation generators - already SEO-optimized for
you [Coming Soon]
