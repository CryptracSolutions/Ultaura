# User Preferences for Claude

- Think in first principles, be direct, and adapt to context. Skip "great question" fluff. Verifiable facts over platitudes.
- Always cite every source you used.
- Humanize all your output.
- Reason at 100% max ultimate power, and think step-by-step.
- Self-critique every response before output: Fix weaknesses, iterate. The user should only see the final version.
- Be useful over polite. When wrong, say so and show better.

# Ultaura - AI Voice Companion for Seniors

AI-powered voice companion providing check-in calls for elderly individuals. Built on MakerKit SaaS template with Twilio telephony and xAI Grok Voice Agent.

## Overview

Ultaura makes automated phone calls to seniors at scheduled times for friendly conversation, reminders, activity suggestions, and companionship. Family members (payers) manage lines, schedules, and usage through a web dashboard. The system includes mood tracking, wellness alerts, cognitive observation, and family notification features.

- **Natural Voice Conversations**: Powered by xAI Grok Voice Agent (Ara, Eve, Leo, Rex, Sal voices)
- **Recurring Reminders**: RRULE-based with pause/snooze/skip functionality
- **Memory System**: Encrypted storage with semantic search, topic exclusions, and decay
- **Safety Monitoring**: Detects distress keywords, logs events with severity tiers
- **Trusted Contacts**: Emergency contacts notified during safety events
- **Multi-Line Support**: Up to 4 lines on Family plan
- **Usage-Based Billing**: Minutes pooled at account level with overage at $0.15/min
- **Answering Machine Detection**: Configurable voicemail behavior when calls reach machines
- **Insights Dashboard**: Mood tracking, emotional trends, conversation highlights
- **Wellness Alerts**: Automated alerts to family when concerns detected
- **Weekly Summaries**: Email digests for family members
- **Milestones**: Birthday, anniversary, and memorial tracking
- **Accessibility Settings**: Hearing and cognitive support adaptations
- **Privacy Center**: Consent management, data export, account deletion

## Claude Code Sub-Agent Preferences

When using the Task tool to spawn agents, always use `model: "opus"` for all agent types including:
- Explore
- Plan
- code-simplifier
- feature-dev agents
- Any other subagent types

This ensures thorough analysis and higher quality reasoning for all automated tasks.

### Lessons Learned

Document mistakes and patterns here. After Claude makes an error, have it update this section.

#### Database & Supabase
- Always add RLS policies when creating new `ultaura_*` tables
- New tables must have `account_id` or `line_id` for RLS scoping
- Run `supabase db diff` to verify migration changes before committing

#### Telephony
- Grok tools must be registered in both `/telephony/src/routes/tools/` AND the prompt definitions in `@ultaura/prompts`
- WebSocket handlers must handle disconnect gracefully (30s drain on SIGTERM)
- Always use the service role client for telephony operations (RLS bypass)

#### React/Next.js
- Server actions go in `/src/lib/ultaura/`
- Use the existing patterns for error handling with `ActionResult<T>` types
- Dashboard pages should use the existing layout components

#### Common Mistakes
- [ ] Forgetting to add new tables to the ARCHITECTURE.md reference
- [ ] Not testing with both payer and line user_type accounts
- [ ] Missing encryption for PII fields (use line/account encryption services)

*Add new lessons as they're discovered.*

### Plan Mode Guidance

Use plan mode (`/plan` or EnterPlanMode) for:
- New features touching multiple services (dashboard + telephony + database)
- Database schema changes or new migrations
- Changes to the call flow or Grok tool handlers
- New API endpoints that span Next.js and telephony
- Refactoring that affects more than 3 files

Skip plan mode for:
- Single-file bug fixes
- UI-only changes within existing components
- Adding new server actions following existing patterns
- Documentation updates

## Call Flow

1. Scheduler triggers outbound call via Twilio (with AMD enabled)
2. Twilio performs Answering Machine Detection:
   - **Human/Unknown**: Proceeds to conversation
   - **Machine**: Applies line's `voicemail_behavior` setting (none/brief/detailed)
   - **Fax**: Hangs up immediately
3. If human, Twilio opens Media Stream WebSocket at `/twilio/media`
4. Telephony bridges audio to Grok Realtime API
5. Grok converses using 48 available tools (reminders, safety, memory, insights, etc.)
6. Call ends, usage recorded in minute ledger
7. Call insights extracted and stored (encrypted)
8. Memory summaries encrypted and stored with embeddings
9. Wellness alerts triggered if concerns detected
10. Weekly summary scheduler aggregates data for family notifications
11. Overage reported to Stripe if applicable

## Reference Documentation

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md):
- Database tables and schemas (56 tables)
- Server actions by module (in `/src/lib/ultaura/`)
- Telephony API endpoints
- Grok tool endpoints (48 tools in `/telephony/src/routes/tools/`)
- Telephony service modules (44 services)
- Next.js API routes

## Operations Notes

- See `telephony/OBSERVABILITY.md` for logging, metrics, and tracing details.
- WebSocket media streams require sticky sessions; ingress should hash on the `callSessionId` query param.
- Scheduler leases include: `schedules`, `reminders`, `weekly-summaries`, `recording-deletions`, `embeddings`, `decay-job`.
- Telephony pods drain active WebSocket calls on SIGTERM/SIGINT (30s max) before exit.
- Internal ops endpoints (require `X-Webhook-Secret`): `/internal/scheduler-status`, `/internal/active-calls`, `/internal/metrics`.
- Prometheus scraping should hit `/internal/metrics` with `X-Webhook-Secret` via ServiceMonitor `httpHeaders` + Secret.

## Security

### Phone Verification
All lines must be verified via Twilio Verify before receiving calls.

### Memory Encryption
AES-256-GCM envelope encryption:
- KEK (Key Encryption Key) in environment
- DEK (Data Encryption Key) per account, wrapped with KEK
- Per-line DEK option for enhanced privacy (enabled by default for new lines)
- AAD binding includes account and line IDs

### Rate Limiting
Distributed rate limiting via Upstash Redis:
- Per-phone verification limits
- Per-IP request limits
- Per-account action limits
- Anomaly detection with cost thresholds

### Safety Monitoring
- Detects distress keywords (suicide, self-harm, hopeless, etc.)
- Logs events with tiers: low, medium, high
- Actions: none, suggested_988, suggested_911, notified_contact
- Wellness alerts sent to family members

### Consent & Opt-out
- Tracks payer/line consent for calls, SMS, data retention
- Voice consent capture during calls
- Respects opt-out requests by channel (calls, SMS, all)
- Topic exclusions for sensitive subjects
- GDPR-compliant data export and deletion

### RLS Policies
All tables have Row Level Security:
- Users access only their organization's data
- Service role required for telephony operations
